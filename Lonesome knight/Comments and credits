#Lonesome Knight

Was stuck at somewhat brute forcing a solution(missed a few cases) but credits to marioyc's solution that provided a more concrete algorithm.

Here one can visualise the whole chessboard as space in a 2D x-y plane at a1=(0,0), with positive x to the right and positive y north. Convert the alphabets to 'x' coordinates and do shifts accordingly. If shifts land out of the board, do not include; else increment.
